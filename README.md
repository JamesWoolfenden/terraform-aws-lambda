module "lambda" {
  source = "github.com/jameswoolfenden/terraform-aws-lambda"
  version= "0.3.40"
  account_id     = data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id
  alarms_enabled = true
  common_tags    = var.common_tags
  description    = "Best Pizza!!"
  filename       = "${path.module}/lambda.zip"
  name           = var.name
  region_name    = data.aws_region.current.name
  role_arn       = data.aws_iam_role.lambda.arn

- Add support for sns subscriptions.
- Add in support for keeping lambda warm.

What alarms are important:

- <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/investigating-spikes-in-aws-lambda-function-concurrency/>

Right sizing Lambdas:

- timeouts to close to invocation length
- no of failed or throttled
- memory usage - am i over provisioned?
- memory usage - more tin required?
- size of payload is related to the start time
